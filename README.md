Codesoft Internship Project Repository Task List:

Task-1> TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION  Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readliy available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passenger, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.  

Task-2> CREADIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION 
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transaction. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classifiction algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transaction as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

Task-3> IRIS FLOWER CLASSFICTION 
The iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine  that you have the measurements of Iris flower categorized by their a machine learning model that can kearn from these measurements and accurrately classify the iris flowers into their respective species.

Task-4> SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customer will purchase, taking into account various factor such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a DataScientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning tchniques in python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decision regarding advertising costs. Byleveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.
